# aws-creds-okta

Obtain temporary AWS Creds from your Okta Profile.

## Usage

Here's an example. All options are required except `okta_mfa_method` which default to TOTP based notification.

```yaml
- name: Create AWS profile
  uses: docker://ghcr.io/mrchief/aws-creds-okta@v1.2.1 # or a tagged release version  
  with:
    aws_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/role-name
    okta_username: okta.user@mycompany.com
    okta_password: ${{ secrets.OKTA_PASSWORD }}
    okta_app_url: https://mycompany.okta.com/home/amazon_aws/1234567890abcdefghij/123
    okta_mfa_seed: ${{ secrets.OKTA_MFA_SEED }}
```

ðŸ’¡ **Note** You can also use the non docker image version of the action by switching to: 

```
  uses: mrchief/aws-creds-okta@<tag|sha|branch>
```

Once this step runs it'll set the following environment variables for subsequent steps:

```shell
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ***
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ***
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN: ***
```

It also masks the actual values in the logs for added security.

### ðŸ’¡ Note

- Currently only supports `totp` authentication. There are plans to add support for other MFA methods. PRs welcome.
- `okta_app_url` can be obtained by right clicking the Okta tile for you AWS account. This setup allows for federated login to different AWS accounts.
- `okta_password` & `okta_mfa_seed` can be set via environment variables `${{ env.OKTA_MFA_SEED }}` although it is not recommended to do so as it can leak secrets. Github repo secrets are the easiest way but if you manage secrets via some other mechanism, you can also use them - these are just normal inputs, you can pass them anything.

## Can I use this

You can use this if you're doing **all** of this:

- you are using Okta for federated logins to AWS accounts
- you have setup Okta MFA with `TOTP` option (use a time based code, similar to Google Authenticator)
- have one or more AWS apps setup in your Okta apps (see screenshot)

## How this works

This action uses [tokendito](https://github.com/dowjones/tokendito) tool to generate temporary AWS credentials. The credentials are generated in the home directory of the container and are then exported as environment variables so the subsequent steps can use them seamlessly.

It uses [mintotp](https://pypi.org/project/mintotp/) to generate a `totp`.
